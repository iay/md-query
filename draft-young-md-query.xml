            <t>
                This document defines a simple protocol for retrieving metadata about named entities, or named
                collections of entities.
                The goal of the protocol is to profile various aspects of HTTP to allow requesters to rely on
                certain, rigorously defined, behaviour.

            <t>
                Many clients of web-based services are capable of consuming descriptive metadata about a service in
                order to customize or obtain information about the client's connection parameters.  While the form of
                the metadata (e.g., JSON, XML) and content varies between services this document specifies a set of
                semantics for HTTP (<xref target="RFC7230"/> et seq.)
                that allow clients to rely on certain behavior.
                The defined behavior is meant to make it easy for clients to perform queries, to be efficient for
                both requesters and responders, and to allow the responder to scale in various ways.

                    The metadata query protocol makes use of the HTTP protocol (<xref target="RFC7230"/>)

                    The underlying HTTP connection MAY make use of any appropriate transport protocol.
                    In particular, the HTTP connection MAY make use of either TCP or TLS at the transport layer.
                    See the <xref target="sec_cons" format="title"/> section for guidance in choosing an
                    appropriate transport protocol.

                    The query protocol uses identifiers to "tag" metadata for single- and multi-entity metadata collections.
                    The assignment of such identifiers to a particular metadata document is the responsibility of the query
                    responder.
                    If a metadata collection already contains a well known identifier it is RECOMMENDED that such a natural
                    identifier is used when possible.

                <t>
                    Upon a successful response the responder MUST return an ETag header and MAY return a Last-Modified header as well.
                    Requesters SHOULD use either or both, with the ETag being preferred, in any subsequent requests for the same resource.
                    In the event that a resource has not changed since the previous request, the requester will receive
                    a 304 (Not Modified) status code as a response.
                </t>
            </section>

            <section title="Content Caching">
                <t>Responders SHOULD include cache control information with successful (200 status code) responses, assuming the responder knows when retrieved metadata is meant to expire.  The responder SHOULD also include cache control information with 404 Not Found responses.  This allows the requester to create and maintain a negative-response cache.  When cache controls are used only the 'max-age' directive SHOULD be used.</t>

            <section title="Content Compression">
                <t>As should be apparent from the required request and response headers this protocol encourages the use of content compression.  This is in recognition that some metadata documents can be quite large or fetched with relatively high frequency.</t>
                <t>Requesters SHOULD support, and advertise support for, gzip compression unless such usage would put exceptional demands on constrained environments. Responders MUST support gzip compression.  Requesters and responders MAY support other compression algorithms.</t>

            <section title="Integrity">
                <t>As metadata often contains information necessary for the secure operation of interacting services it is RECOMMENDED that some form of content integrity checking be performed. This may include the use of TLS at the transport layer, digital signatures present within the metadata document, or any other such mechanism.</t>
            </section>
            <section title="Confidentiality">
                <t>In many cases service metadata is public information and therefore confidentiality is not required.  In the cases where such functionality is required, it is RECOMMENDED that both the requester and responder support TLS.  Other mechanisms, such as XML encryption, MAY also be supported.</t>

            <section title="Authentication">
                <t>
                    All responders which require client authentication to view retrieved information MUST support
                    the use of HTTP basic authentication (<xref target="RFC7235"/>,
                    <xref target="RFC2617"/>/<xref target="I-D.basicauth"/>) over TLS.
                    Responders SHOULD also support the use of X.509 client certificate authentication.

                    Adopted as base for draft-young-md-query-00.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Updated author and list of contributors.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Changed ipr from "pre5378Trust200902" to "trust200902",
                    submission type from IETF to independent and
                    category from experimental to informational.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Added empty IANA considerations section.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Minor typographical nits but (intentionally) no substantive
                    content changes.
                </t>

                <t>
                    Split into two documents: this one is as agnostic as possible around questions such as
                    metadata format and higher level protocol use cases, a new layered document describes the
                    detailed requirements for SAML support.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Rewrite <xref target="protocol.request.identifier"/> to clarify construction of the
                    request URL and its relationship to the base URL.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Added <xref target="transport_protocol"/> to clarify that the transport protocol underlying HTTP
                    may be either TCP or SSL/TLS.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Clarify position on <xref target="http_version">HTTP versions</xref> which may be used to underly this protocol.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Added Change Log modelled on draft-ietf-httpbis-http2.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Added a reference to <xref target="STD68"/>.
                    Use ABNF to describe request syntax.
                    Replace transformed identifier concept with extended identifiers (this also resulted in the removal
                    of any discussion of specific transformed identifier formats).
                    Add grammar to distinguish basic from extended identifiers.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Changed the required response when the result can not be validly expressed in the requested
                    format from 500 to 406.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Removed the '+' operator and all references to multiple identifiers in queries. If more complex queries
                    are required, these will be reintroduced at a different path under the base URL.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Added a section describing <xref target="sec_protocol_extension_points" format="title"/>.
                </t>
            </section>

                <t>
                    Added REFEDS RFC stream boilerplate.

                <t>
                    Tidied up some normative language.

                    Introduced a normative reference to <xref target="STD66"/>.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Reworked the definition of the base URL so that a non-empty path ending with '/'
                    is required. This allows the definition of request URLs to be simplified.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Clarified the definition of the base URL to exclude a query component; corrected
                    the terminology for the fragment identifier component.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Added the definition for the query for all entities in
                    <xref target="protocol.request.all"/>.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Corrected an example in <xref target="query.example"/> to include the
                    required double quotes in the value of an ETag header. Added text to clarify
                    the base URL and identifier being used in the example.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Simplified the definition of identifiers, so that any non-empty identifier
                    is accepted and no semantics are defined for particular structures. Extended
                    syntaxes such as the <spanx style="verb">{sha1}</spanx> notation for
                    transformed identifiers are now left to profiles.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Remove incidental references to SSL.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Remove status code 501 ("not implemented") as it is no longer referenced.

                <t>
                    Updated to rely on the new definition of HTTP/1.1 in <xref target="RFC7230"/> et seq.
                    instead of RFC 2616.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Corrected <xref target="protocol.response"/> to indicate that the request

                <t>
                    Added an Editorial Note to help direct readers
